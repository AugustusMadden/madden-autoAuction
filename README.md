# Auto Auction
  ## Description

  For this project, we have created a car auction website that allows registered users to list their car for sale or bid on other user's cars. We have utilized knowledge in sequelize, handlebars view engine, and Heroku deployment among others to fulfil this task. My method of contributing to this relied heavily on using RESTful CRUD functions to manipulate the backend API and present the object information to the user.
